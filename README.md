# Resale Ticket Pricing by Music Genres

A statistical analysis and model of ticket resale prices using concert features and musical features. The ticket resale market in the US is estimated to be a 5 billion dollar market. Given the size of the industry, it's important to understand how to sell tickets in a fashion that will find you a buyer but also not to leave money off the table. Therefore, I'm interested in the different factors that relate to the average resale price of concert tickets. 

# Project Goal
Predict average ticket resale prices with features covering the concert, itself, and musical features of the artist.

# Dataset and Methods

Used the SeatGeek API to retrieve information on ticket resales and the Spotify API to retrieve information on musical features of artists playing concerts. 

Tools: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Seaborn, Multiprocessing, Spotipy, Jupyter Notebook
